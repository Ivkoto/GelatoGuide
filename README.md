# GelatoGuide

This website has started as a final course defense project and now it continues as a website with real purposes for all those gelato lovers all around the world. It is still in development, but also it's alive with free access (check the link below). There is still no real information in it, but I hope that soon will be fully ready. It should have general information about the best gelato places, starting from Sofia, Bulgaria, expanding in the whole country, and hope...in other countries in Europe. Also blog with a lot of articles, news, and recipes. And finally, online shop, with all of our beautiful handmade Jesmonite coasters and soy candles.
